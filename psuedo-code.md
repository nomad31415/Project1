########## THINGS TO THINK ABOUT ##########
- Using a face recognition API to create a website where users who are in the database already can log into their system
    - EXAMPLE: Access to building, clocking in to work, signing in for the gym, signing into online classroom, accessing public computer
    - Basically a form of identification that is more secure than using a username/pw to prevent unwanted guests.
    - Or to really keep track if someone is going to class/or if a worker is really clocking in at a specific time.


## EXAMPLE ONE: GYM
- User already signs up with gym with all of their information
- Instead of checking in by writing their name or a barcode, they stand in front of a camera to sign in.
- This prevents someone else from using their membership

## EXAMPLE TWO: Work
- User should already be in the system with their information
- Instead of coworker clocking in someone else so they hit their hour mark, a face scan is used to know time/date of arrival/departure.
- If worker claims hours were wrong, the face scan would have all the information about it.

## EXAMPLE THREE: School/Online School/SAT test etc
- Again, user should already be in the system
- Face scans them in order to attend class so someone else isn't checking in for them or taking an important exam for them
- Taking away risk of fake ID and such

## EXAMPLE FOUR: Video Game log in credentials (Tournaments or boosting)
- Face is already tied to account
- When logging in, a face scan is used to verify user
- This prevents someone else from helping user or boosting user to a higher level from fraudelently using their account against game TOS

#### WEB BUILDING ####
- Front page: What is it?
- Links to include: Information, applications, benefits, case studies (ID theft, fraud -- maybe using chart.js: https://www.chartjs.org/)
- ID theft stats: https://idtheftinfo.org/id-theft-statistics-a-studies

## INDEX.HTML
- A brief showcase of the overall project
- Try to entice people to want to read more into our work
- Three Main Objectives (needs work)
1. Security || Materialize icon code: security
2. Convenience || Materialize icon code: thumb_up
3. Ease || Materialize icon code: mood


## ABOUT-US.HTML
- Talk about the people contributing to this application
- or take this page out if it isn't necessary


## THESIS.HTML
- This page will go into detail about what the application is and what it can do
- Why it's useful, the direction of the whole application, and other information we might find useful to share
- This page will basically be our thought process through-out the project


## EXAMPLE.HTML
- This is where we show our example/work in action
- Accessing Webcam: https://www.kirupa.com/html5/accessing_your_webcam_in_html5.htm
https://davidwalsh.name/browser-camera
- This page would basically show the back-end work that is used to create our project


### CASE STUDIES
- May take this page out or leave it, not sure yet
- In order to show the progress and really talk about the thesis, I feel as though it is important to showcase stats and other information regarding identity theft and/or fraud 
- This is where chart.js would be used to show charts of ID theft/fraud on the internet etc
- I firmly believe that when we show images with actual stats, it creates a more realistic picture for people who may have doubts about the overall project
- Creates legitimacy
