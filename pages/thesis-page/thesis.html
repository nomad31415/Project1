            Our original thought process was to create an application where we incorporate a face recognition API. With
            that, we decided to brainstorm ideas on how or when such an API would be useful, especially in our current ability range. What can we create? And the main objective, <b>are we able to</b>? We decided to work on an application that could be used as a real world application. As a first project and four minds with different levels of coding, we figured how hard could this be?
        </p> <br><br>
        <p>
            We quickly learned that it actually was extremely hard (with our current ability). The more we learned about the different programs and ways to do things, we realizd how much harder it was to obtain the end goal of our application. 
        </p><br><br>
        <p>
            What we have for this project is an application that works for places such as: the gym, work, school, libraries, etc. Anywhere accessible to a large amount of people. As of right now, most places use either a picture ID or a barcode for people to log into their system. However, that still leaves room for people to cheat the system. Our application requires the company to take an initial photograph of their user. Store it into a system. Ultimately use a face recognition API to capture the user and be used as an authenication to make sure they are who they say they are.
